  #Calculte BMR by Harris-Benedict equation: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7784146/#:~:text=In%20men%2C%20the%20Harris%2DBenedict,4.6756%20x%20age%20in%20years.
  Men:  BMR = 66.4730+(13.7516*weight in kg) + (5.0033*height in cm) - (6.7550*age in years)
  Women:BMR = 655.0955+(9.5634*weight in kg) + (1.8496*height in cm) -(4.6756*age in years)

  #Calculte Activity level by Harris-Benedict equation to factor in activity level: https://www.livestrong.com/article/526442-the-activity-factor-for-calculating-calories-burned/
  Sedentary (little or no exercise): BMR × 1.2
  Lightly active (light exercise/sports 1-3 days/week): BMR × 1.375
  Moderately active (moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week): BMR × 1.5
  Very active (hard exercise/sports 6-7 days a week): BMR × 1.725
  Extremely active (very hard exercise/sports & physical job or 2x training): BMR × 1.9

  #Calculate Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE):
  TDEE = BMR × Activity Level

  #Determine Caloric Intake for Goals:
  To lose weight: Subtract a certain number of calories (usually 500 to 1000) from your TDEE per day for a gradual weight loss of about 1-2 pounds per week.
  To maintain weight: Keep your caloric intake equal to your TDEE.
  To gain weight: Add a certain number of calories (usually 500 to 1000) to your TDEE per day for a gradual weight gain.

  #Calculate Macronutrient Distribution:
  Protein: 15-25% of total daily calories (1 gram of protein = 4 calories)
  Fat: 20-35% of total daily calories (1 gram of fat = 9 calories)
  Carbohydrates: The remaining calories after protein and fat are calculated, divided by 4 (1 gram of carbs = 4 calories)
